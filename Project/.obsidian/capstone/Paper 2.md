Knowledge Graphs & LLMs: Fine-Tuning Vs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation

This blog post highlights the limitations of LLMs, including knowledge cutoff, potential for hallucinations, and lack of user customization. These challenges pose significant hurdles in relying solely on LLMs for generating accurate and reliable information

Two main strategies are discussed: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation.

The blog post compares the pros and cons of both approaches. While fine-tuning offers some benefits in updating internal knowledge, it falls short in addressing knowledge cutoff and hallucination issues.

knowledge graph part is similar to  [[Paper 1]]   but advanced info on neo4j is not discussed ******
