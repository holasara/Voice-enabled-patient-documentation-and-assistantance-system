Knowledge Graphs & LLMs: Harnessing Large Language Models with Neo4j
https://medium.com/neo4j/harnessing-large-language-models-with-neo4j-306ccbdd2867

Neo4j's NaLLM project aims to explore and utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in conjunction with Neo4j's graph database technology, opening up new possibilities for data processing and interaction between humans and machines

By leveraging LLMs' ability to understand and generate human-like text, alongside graph database technology, the project aims to make complex data more accessible and usable for decision-making 

Utilizing LLMs to extract structured information from unstructured data sources such as PDFs and text documents. LLMs assist in deciphering entities, discerning relationships, and eliminating redundancies, streamlining the knowledge graph creation process.
